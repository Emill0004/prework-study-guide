# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This project is a study guide containing the most important notes I took during the prework. This study guide was made for two reasons, to practice the basics of web development, and to consolidate my notes in an easy to read application. the main problem this project aims to solve is helping boot camp students keep track of and sort their prework notes. For me, this project was mostly a refresher for information that I've learned in previous classes.
